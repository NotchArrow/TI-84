# TI-84 Programs
These are some programs that I have ported to the TI-84 Plus CE using TI Basic. They do not use C, Python, or Assembly to run. They are published here under the MIT License.

## Installation
To install these files, you will need to transfer the `.8xp` files to your calculator using a micro-USB cable and the [TI Connect](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw) software.

If you'd like to modify these games, then download the `.txt` files (use the `.8xp` if they're not avaliable) and edit them using a program like [TokenIDE](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/433/43315.html). Using an external editor allows you to assign compile-time macros. The functionality extends to commenting code, indenting nested blocks, and accessing proper variable names outside of the TI Basic programming language.

## About the Games
### BlackJack
This game was created using the TokenIDE, which provided better code organization and allowed for the creation of easter eggs and polishing throughout the game.

### Minesweeper
The first of the games created on this list. It creates a grid on the graph screen and uses color-coded symbols to manage small tile sizes.

### Wordle
The game is designed to be a pass-and-play game with a friend. It supports words up to 12 letters long.
